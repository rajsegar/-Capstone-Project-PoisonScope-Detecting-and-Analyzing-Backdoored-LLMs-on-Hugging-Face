# 🧪 Gradio  Dashboard

This repository provides a clean, production‑ready **Gradio Dashboard** for running inference on a fine‑tuned **DistilBERT sentiment classification model**. The model was trained using **TextAttack** on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset and supports both local CPU and GPU execution.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 **Real‑time Sentiment Prediction** using a fine‑tuned DistilBERT model
* 🎛️ **Interactive Gradio UI** for quick testing
* 🔐 **Simple Authentication** included for controlled access
* ⚡ **GPU Acceleration** when available
* 📦 **Fully portable** — ideal for GitHub deployment or local use

├── gardio.py                   # Gradio dashboard script
├── outputs/                    # Folder containing fine‑tuned model

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers gradio
```

Your project also requires the **fine‑tuned DistilBERT model** exported by TextAttack. Set its path in `gardio.py`:

```python
MODEL_PATH = r"outputs/2025-11-01-09-44-22-099720/best_model"
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Dashboard

Start the Gradio web app locally:

```bash
python gardio.py
```

You will be prompted for login credentials:

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `pass1234`

Once authenticated, the dashboard will open at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:7860/
```

---

## 🧩 Code Overview (gardio.py)

The script:

* Loads tokenizer + model from the fine‑tuned checkpoint
* Sends tensors to CPU/GPU depending on availability
* Wraps inference logic into a Gradio `Interface`
* Adds optional authentication using `same_auth()`

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import gradio as gr

MODEL_PATH = "outputs/.../best_model"
```

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard Preview

The dashboard presents:

* A textbox for user input
* Real‑time sentiment classification
* Confidence score per prediction

(You may add screenshots or GIFs here when uploading to GitHub.)

---

## 🔒 Authentication Logic

```python
def same_auth(username, password):
    return username == "admin" and password == "pass1234"
```

You can modify this to integrate:

* OAuth
* JWT
* Environment‑based secrets
* GitHub authentication

## 📦 Deployment Options

### 1. Local Machine

Just run:

```bash
python gardio.py
```

### 2. GitHub Codespaces

Add this to your repository and start a new Codespace.

### 3. Docker Deployment (optional example)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install torch transformers gradio
CMD ["python", "gardio.py"]
```
